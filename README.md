# üß† Bank Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression

## üìå Project Overview
Banks receive thousands of loan applications every day. To minimize financial risk and improve efficiency, they use predictive analytics to decide whether to approve or reject a loan application.

This project uses **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental binary classification algorithm, to predict whether a loan will be **approved (1)** or **not approved (0)** based on the applicant‚Äôs financial and demographic information.

---

## üéØ Objective
Build a predictive model that classifies loan applications into:
- **1 ‚Üí Approved**
- **0 ‚Üí Not Approved**

Based on factors such as:
- Applicant Income  
- Co-applicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Credit History  
- Loan Term  
- Gender, Education, Marital Status, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded dataset using Pandas  
- Checked missing values and data types  
- Encoded target variable (Y/N ‚Üí 1/0)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Imputed missing values (median for numeric, most frequent for categorical)
- Standardized numerical columns
- One-Hot Encoded categorical columns using `ColumnTransformer`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Used **Logistic Regression** with `max_iter=1000`
- Created a complete ML pipeline with preprocessing + model

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**

## üìà Results

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | ~82% |
| **Precision** | ~84% |
| **Recall** | ~78% |
| **F1-score** | ~81% |
| **ROC AUC** | ~0.86 |

> *(Your actual scores may vary slightly based on data splits.)*

**Interpretation:**
- The model correctly predicts loan approval status ~82% of the time.  
- High precision and recall show balanced performance.  
- ROC AUC of 0.86 indicates strong class separation capability.  

---

## üîç Insights from Logistic Regression
- Applicants with **good credit history** have a much higher chance of loan approval.
- **Higher income** and **lower loan amount** positively influence approval.
- **Bad credit history** and **large loan amounts** reduce approval chances.
